# s3sitedeploy - Wercker S3 Static Site Deployment Step
You need s3sitedeploy if:

* You have a static site built with Wercker
* You want it deployed to S3
* You want more granular Cache-Control settings than provided by s3sync

This is still a work in progress - not recommended for production use.
